# VIREON Monument (Alpha)

**A public, auditable foundation of theorems, proofs, and verification artifacts built under the VIREON logic.**

This repository is a *monument* — not a blog. Everything here is designed to be:
- **Proof-first** (theorem → proof → assumptions → corollaries)
- **Verifiable** (where possible: code, reproducibility notes, and checklists)
- **Tamper-evident** (hashes / manifests for artifacts when included)
- **Open** (Apache-2.0)

## Structure

- `FOUNDATIONS/` — the core axioms, definitions, and kernel theorems
- `THEOREMS/` — one folder per theorem (statement, proof, notes, references)
- `BINDINGS/` — modern bindings (transformers, diffusion, RL certification, etc.)
- `PROOFPACKS/` — reproducible artifact packs (manifests + verification scripts)
- `TOOLS/` — helpers to build manifests, verify packs, lint proofs, and run checks
