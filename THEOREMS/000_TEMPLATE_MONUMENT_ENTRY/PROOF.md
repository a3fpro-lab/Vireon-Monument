# Proof (Template)

## Proof sketch or full proof

Write a complete proof here.

Rules:
- Define all symbols before use.
- If you cite a result, cite it in `REFERENCES.md`.
- If you rely on computation, link to `PROOFPACK/` and describe the verifier.

## If computational evidence is used

Include:
1. What was computed?
2. What is the numerical claim?
3. What is the verifier command?
4. What would falsify it?
